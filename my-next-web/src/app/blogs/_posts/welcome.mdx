Here's a simple footnote,[^1] and here's a longer one.[^bignote]

~~The world is flat.~~ We now know that the world is round.

Gone camping! :tent: Be back soon.

That is so funny! :joy:

I need to highlight these ==very important words==.

[^1]: This is the first footnote.
[^bignote]: Here's one with multiple paragraphs and code.

    Indent paragraphs to include them in the footnote.

    ```javascript
    const test = { a: "b" };
    ```

    Add as many paragraphs as you like.
