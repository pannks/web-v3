"Bun" is an all-in-one toolkit for JavaScript and TypeScript applications.
It comes as a single executable called "bun." At its core, it includes the Bun runtime, a fast JavaScript runtime designed as a drop-in replacement for Node.js.
The runtime is written in `Zig` and powered by JavaScriptCore, which significantly improves startup times and reduces memory usage.

### Installation

```sh
# with install script (recommended)
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash

# with npm
npm install -g bun

# with Homebrew
brew tap oven-sh/bun
brew install bun

# with Docker
docker pull oven/bun
docker run --rm --init --ulimit memlock=-1:-1 oven/bun
```

### Run a script

Bun can also execute "scripts" from your `package.json.` Add the following script:

```json
{
    "name": "quickstart",
    "module": "index.ts",
    "type": "module",
    "scripts": {
        "start": "bun run index.ts"
    },
    "devDependencies": {
        "bun-types": "^0.7.0"
    }
}
```

then run with

```bash
bun run start
```
